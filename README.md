### Team Coding Conventions
Performing actions in GitHub (creating a branch/PR, merging a PR) will automatically transition issues in Jira as long as you follow the naming conventions below, so there is no need to manually transition issues.
##### Branches
* Create a branch off of main for each individual task you work on. You can create a branch through Jira if you'd like.
* Each branch should start with the task number (so it can be identified by Jira) and be descriptive of the task it addresses (ex. `PIN-12-short-task-name`).
* Make and push branches as soon as possible (ideally before you start development) so others can easily see your progress.
##### Pull Requests
* Pull Requests should also all start with the Jira task number (ex. [PIN-12] Implement user profile page).
* Once you make a PR, request review from the person who you think has the greatest understanding of the component you are working on and can give you the best feedback.
* Once the reviewer accepts a PR, it can be merged into main. After it is merged, delete the branch you were developing on.
