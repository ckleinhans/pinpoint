# PinPoint

### Team Coding Conventions
* Create a branch off of main for each individual task you work on. You can create a branch through Jira if you'd like.
* Each branch should start with the task number (so it can be identified by Jira) and be descriptive of the task it addresses (ex. PIN-12-<short-task-name>).
* Pull Requests should also all start with the Jira task number (ex. [PIN-12] Implement user profile page).
* Once you make a PR, request review from the person who you think has the greatest understanding of the component you are working on and can give you the best feedback.
* Once the reviewer accepts a PR, it can be merged into main. After it is merged, delete the branch you were developing on.
