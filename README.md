# PinPoint: Find new places & people one pin at a time
### App Installation
If you'd like to install and run the app please download the APK from the most recent tagged release. The app will not work properly if you try to build it yourself due to missing API keys. You can also download and use the app through Firebase App Distribution by [clicking here](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/b65b91f7ee488b35) and signing in with your Google Account. If you do not install the app using Firebase App Distribution click the "Not Now" option on the prompt that asks if you want to sign into your App Distribution test account.

#### What is Firebase App Distribution?
[Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution) is a service offered by Firebase that allows us to easily distribute up to date versions of our app to testers. A tester signs in using their Google Account and they are then prompted to install the most up to date app version we have published. It also notifies users in the app when there is a newer version available so they can install it easily and stay up to date. Firebase App Distribution is by no means required to use PinPoint, so feel free to stick to the standard APK download if you prefer.
